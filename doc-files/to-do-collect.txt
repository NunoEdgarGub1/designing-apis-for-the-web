To Do List
==========

We keep track of:
- Action (Finish Q3 Summary, Call Barb in Accounting, etc.)
- Due Date
- Category (Sales, Marketing, Operations, etc.)

We share a single list with the team.
We add items throughout the day
We sort by Due Date to figure out what to do next
We remove them from the list when they are completed
